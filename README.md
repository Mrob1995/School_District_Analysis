# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project was to convert a large pool of dirty data into a data frame to clean, aggregate, and analyze it. 

### Analysis and Challenges
The gap between public and charter schools is subtle but defined. Students consistently show worse performance in Math regardless of the type of school they attend, but there is a marked uptick in the mean math score of charter students in grades 9-11. I included an additional dataframe comparing math scores to individual school budgets as well. It's enough data that it may be better demonstrated visually than as a long table, but it would be interesting to see any consistent trends. At a glance, dollar investment in the school doesn't seem to have a direct link to student success in math specifically.
